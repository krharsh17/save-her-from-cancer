	<h1 class="article_title">Impact of Cancer Awareness Drive on Generating Awareness of and Improving Screening for Cervical Cancer: A Study Among Schoolteachers in India</h1>
	<p class="article_author">krharsh17 | 11/18/2019, 2:44:11 PM</p>
	<p class="article_text">Cancer is a major public health problem both in our country and worldwide because of its disease burden, fatality, and tendency toward increased incidence.1 Globally, cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer among all populations and third most common type of cancer after breast and lung cancers among women.2 The global burden of cervical cancer is disproportionately high in developing countries, where 85% of the estimated 493,000 new cases and 273,000 deaths occur worldwide.3 India, which accounts for one sixth of the world’s population, also bears one fifth of the world’s cervical cancer burden.4 Over the past 40 years, mortality resulting from carcinoma of the cervix has fallen because of improved treatment and the introduction of national screening programs.5 The Papanicolaou (Pap) test is the main screening method used for the secondary prevention of cervical cancer. It can detect precancerous cells easily.6 The Pap test is an effective method of detecting, preventing, and delaying the progress of cervical cancer.<br><br>

Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer mortality among women in India; however, it is a largely preventable disease.8 In India, the cervical cancer incidence is one fifth of the world’s incidence.9 Awareness and health-seeking practices have been shown to be poor in many developing countries, necessitating the need for proper awareness programs.10-12 With improvement in cancer technology, we have been able to improve quality of life, but improvement in survival is still questionable. In India, late presentation is attributed to many factors, notably a lack of knowledge and awareness of and a lethargic attitude toward safe health practices.
<br><br>
Several studies have shown that the knowledge of cervical cancer and practices for early detection are at a low level among women.12 Because early detection is one way to reduce morbidity and mortality resulting from cervical cancer, there is work going on, although limited, to increase knowledge, safe practices, and attitudes regarding cervical cancer among schoolteachers in India. The purpose of this study is to measure the level of awareness of cervical cancer risk factors and safe practices among college teachers of different states of India and the impact of awareness programs on changes in the adoption of safe practices for prevention and early detection.<br><br></p>
