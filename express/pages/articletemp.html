	<h1 class="article_title">Cancer Research</h1>
	<p class="article_author">krharsh17 | 11/17/2019, 8:19:49 PM</p>
	<p class="article_text">Cancer research encompasses a broad array of research and includes a diverse range of specific research
topics. Within this report, cancer research is defined as
research where the published results include ‘cancer’ or
‘oncology’ within the title, abstract, or list of keywords of
the publications, as indexed in the Scopus database. This
includes all publication types, namely articles, reviews,
conference papers, book chapters, notes, letters, short
surveys, editorials, articles in press, erratum, books,
conference reviews, business articles, and abstract reports. Articles represent 77% of the research, and reviews
represent 14% of the publications retrieved. The countries selected for analysis produce the highest number of
cancer research publications in 2014. Top cancer research
institutions were identified by selecting the institutions
with the highest number of citations in cancer research
over the period 2011-2015.<br>
In 2014, cancer research represents over 4 % of all research performed globally, reflecting the huge amount of
effort that has been invested worldwide to address this
multifaceted and complex disease. Today it is the leading
cause of premature death in 28 European countries1
and across the United States (US)2. Worldwide, cancer
research output has increased year on year over the past
decade and has seen notable advances in our understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of this disease. For
example, to date, the US Food and Drug Administration
has approved two vaccines (Gardasil, and later Cervarix) against Human Papilloma Virus (HPV), a virus that
can cause cervical cancer in women. While initially the
vaccines were only approved for young women and girls,
research that linked HPV to a variety of other cancers
led to the expansion of the vaccine recommendation to
young men and boys as well. This single advance has cut
cervical cancer risk, making it one of the most preventable cancers. Similarly in 2001, Imatinib (Gleevec) was
approved for the targeted treatment of a rare chronic
myelogenous leukemia. By attacking specific molecular
defects in patients while successfully sparing healthy
cells, this treatment transformed a rare deadly cancer
from being a disease with an acute three to five year life
expectancy, into a more chronic long-term, manageable
condition. Despite such advances, the impact of cancer
remains high and the number of cases is projected to
nearly double over the next twenty years as the global
population ages3.<br>
Analysis of cancer research reveals that the US hosts a
large fraction of the world’s leading cancer research institutions4 (see Cancer Research Institutions Map) and cancer research output from the US represents the largest
share of global output in the field (see Figure 1). The US
share of cancer research has been declining over the past
decade. This is largely the result of significant increase
in China’s cancer research publication output, which
constitutes 17% of the global publication share in 2014,
up from 5% in 2005 (see Figure 1). The impact of cancer
research, which can be examined via field-weighted
citation impact5 (FWCI), has risen over the past decade
for most of the countries included in this analysis. China
has seen a particularly large increase in FWCI from just
above 0.5 in 2005 to above 1.2 in 2014. Japan, France,
Germany, Italy, and the UK have also seen an overall increase in FWCI over the past decade while the FWCI for
US cancer research has been stable over the past decade.</p>
