# save-her-from-cancer
A platform intended for women who have looked cancer in the eye at some point of their lives

------------------------

The project consists of a web platform aided by node servers which aims at helping women suffering/having suffered from any form of cancer to come together and share their stories.

The web platform is planned to have
- a section on the various types of cancer that affect women
- a section for doctors to post and women to read articles on cancer
- a section for survivors to share their stories
- a quiz for users to check themselves for the obvious signs of cancer
- a section that helps users search a self-help center nearest to them

*This project is being developed for a class project*
